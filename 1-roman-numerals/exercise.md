# Introduction

The Roman Numeral system is one of the number systems they taught us during early
days at school. We leared that even letters can be used to signify a number.
I haven't done my research on why Romans decided to have such a number system
but if it worked, hey, it wasn't a stupid idea! 

# Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to write a script / program that accepts any
year number input and and gives out the the number expressed in Roman Numerals.

Accept only values from year 1 to the current year.

If you want to add some validation, go ahead but it's not required.

# How it works

As a refresher (just in case they didn't teach you how to do it)

*Symbol* | I | V | X | L | C | D | M
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
*Value* | 1 | 5 | 10 | 50 | 100 | 500 | 1000

A smaller value character placed before either of the next two higher character
invokes the subtractive notation

ex. 
```
IV = -1 + 5 = 4
IX = -1 + 10 = 9
XL = -10 + 50 = 40
```

# What language should you use?

Whichever you are comfortable with as long as you can state the prerequisite
for running the code or share an online editor that can interpret your code.
